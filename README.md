# EDM-Genre

A simple web app using Spotify's API to get the genre of a song, and then its subgenre as well. I built this to get a better idea as to what genre certain EDM songs I was listening to were.

### Running the app

Download the source code and cd into the edm-genre folder. run `npm start`. You need a Spotify account in order to run the app (its free).

If the app doesn't load or doesn't give you an option to log in, you may need to check to see if the token is out of date. If it is, delete it and refresh, you should be able to log in again.

### Areas for improvement

Use AI methods to track trends and based on those trends have it output the genre. Also can use more of Spotify's data to make it even more correct.
