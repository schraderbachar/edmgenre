# EDM-Genre

A simple web app using Spotify's API to get the genre of a song, and then its subgenre as well. I built this to get a better idea as to what genre certain EDM songs I was listening to were.

### Running the app

Download the source code and cd into the edm-genre folder. run `npm start`. You need a Spotify account in order to run the app (its free).

### Areas for improvement

Use AI methods to track trends and based on those trends have it output the genre. Also can use more of Spotify's data to make it even more correct.
